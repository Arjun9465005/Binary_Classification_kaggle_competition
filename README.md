# Binary_Classification_kaggle_competition
Before diving into the data, we need understand the problem we are trying to solve and the goals of our analysis. This helps in directing our exploration and identifying relevant patterns.For this Health Insurance data,this dataset is about an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers. Now we need build a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

At last we use the StratifiedKFold with Catboost method which perform well and we got accuracy upto 0.89595 that helped me to hold 215 position on the kaggle leaderboard in Binary Classification competition
